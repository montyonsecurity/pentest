# mysqlbrute

Simple bash script to use a list of usernames, passwords, and hosts to bruteforce MySQL credentials.

Currently, it uses hardcoded file names (users.txt, passwords.txt, and hosts.txt) and they must be in the scripts working directory.

Hosts must include port, such as 127.0.0.1:3306. And all files are one entry per line.

Any successful authentications will result in the command being echoed to screen.
