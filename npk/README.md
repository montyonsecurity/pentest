# NPK Installer

[NPK](https://github.com/Coalfire-Research/npk) is "a mostly-serverless distributed hash cracking platform" built by Coalfire Labs. This bash script requests the variables needed for install and does it for you.

The directions on logging into your NPK instance will be sent to the email you supply.

You can view the documentation for NPK [here](https://github.com/Coalfire-Research/npk/wiki).

The things it asks for are your AWS username (required), phone number (optional), and email (required). Username to interact with AWS CLI, phone number for critical NPK alerts, and email for where to send the login credentials for NPK. All the variables are used to edit files locally.

It is highly recommended to run ../gcp-install.sh before install.sh if you are running this on GCP because that script handles updating keys
