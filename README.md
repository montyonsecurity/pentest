# pentest

Automating high-level network and web application analysis together.

Some portions of the tool have been re-purposed to work independently as well, check sub-directories.
- 3dt - "Dangling DNS Discovery Tool"
- autowasp - "Automated Web App Testing with ZAP"
- npk - "Automate installing NPK from Coalfire Labs"

The setup scripts also install tools purely for ease of life in manual follow-up analysis.

## disclaimer

Some of the tools within this repo can cause damage so a system. Do not use them against anything you are not authorized to test.

It is highly recommended that all users have a firm grasp of the tools listed below (especially in the ones in the "credit" section), understand the risks associated with each tool independently, and then realize this framework puts their main capabilities all in one package.

## credit

Much of the credit goes to the developers of the follwoing tools, this script just puts them together.
- device-pharmer
- dirb
- dnsenum
- exploitdb
- netcat
- nikto
- nmap
- zap-cli 
- zaproxy

The device-pharmer package (Shodan API):

2. Does not use scan credits in any circumstance
3. Will look in the home directory of the root account for the Shodan API key (/root/.shodan/api\_key)
