Dangling Domain Discovery Tool

## what is a dangling dns domain
Medium has a [great article](https://medium.com/@nabeelxy/dangling-dns-records-are-a-real-vulnerability-361f2a29d37f) on it. In short, it is the improper clean up of DNS records that can result in assets being left in the open for anyone to register.

## dependencies
To install only the dependencies for this tool, you will need to install dnsenum and dirb (for the wordlists).

	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install dnsenum seclists -y
